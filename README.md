# Dynamic Resource Monitoring System using MinMaxStack

## Overview
This project implements a **Dynamic Resource Monitoring System** using a custom **MinMaxStack** data structure to track CPU and memory usage of virtual machines (VMs) in real-time. The system enables **O(1)** retrieval of the minimum and maximum CPU and memory values at any point, helping to optimize resource allocation and scale cloud resources dynamically.

## Features

- **Efficient Resource Tracking**: Monitors CPU and memory usage in real time.
- **MinMaxStack**: Custom stack data structure to maintain the minimum and maximum resource usage with O(1) time complexity.
- **Push and Pop Operations**: Efficiently adds and removes resource updates while keeping track of min/max values.
- **Real-time Decision Making**: Supports real-time resource scaling and alerts based on resource usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used to implement the MinMaxStack and the resource monitoring system.
- **Data Structures**: Custom stack implementation with enhanced functionalities to keep track of min and max values.
